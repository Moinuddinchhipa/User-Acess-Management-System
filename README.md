# User-Acess-Management-System
Project Overview: The User Access Management System (UAMS) is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of managing user access to various software applications within an organization. The system enhances security and efficiency by providing a centralized platform for user registration, authentication, software management, and access request handling.

Key Features:

User Registration (Sign-Up):

New users can register for the system with a default role of "Employee."
Registration data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
User Authentication (Login):

Registered users (Employees, Managers, Admins) can log in to the system.
User sessions are managed to ensure secure access.
Software Management (Admin Only):

Admins can add new software applications to the system.
Software details include name, description, and access levels (Read, Write, Admin).
Access Request System (Employee):

Employees can request access to software applications.
Requests include the software name, access type, and a reason for the request.
Approval System (Manager):

Managers can view and manage pending access requests.
Requests can be approved or rejected, and the status is updated in the database.
Responsibilities:

Development:
Designed and implemented the backend logic using Java Servlets.
Created JSP pages for user interfaces, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
Managed the PostgreSQL database schema and data operations.
Testing:
Conducted unit tests to ensure the reliability of the system.
Performed integration testing to verify the interaction between different components.
Deployment:
Configured and deployed the application on an Apache Tomcat server.
Managed the build process using Maven.
Achievements:

Successfully developed a robust and secure user access management system.
Enhanced organizational efficiency by centralizing access request management.
Improved security by implementing role-based access control and user authentication.
Skills Demonstrated:

Proficiency in Java and web development technologies.
Strong understanding of database management and SQL.
Experience with web application deployment and server configuration.
Effective problem-solving and team collaboration skills.
Impact: The UAMS has significantly improved the security and efficiency of user access management within the organization. It has streamlined the process for employees to request access to software applications and provided managers with a centralized platform to manage these requests, leading to better resource utilization and enhanced security protocols.
